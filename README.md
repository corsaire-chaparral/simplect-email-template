## How to use
You can **[download it now](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmaesta/simplect-email-template/master/simplect-latest.zip)** to use right away _(recomended)_

Or, if you are a very advanced user, read below.

## How to make it yours

- Clone
- Edit `kit/_variables.kit` (it's a [Kit file](https://codekitapp.com/help/kit/))
- Compile (with [Prepros](https://prepros.io), for example)
- Zip everything
- Post the zip to your Mautic (on `Config > Themes`)

I undestand that this is not an easy process, but it was the easier one found to allow customization.

If you have a better way, please share!
